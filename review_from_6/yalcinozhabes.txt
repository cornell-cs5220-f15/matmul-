# What Went Well #
- I like that you every time you present an optimization, you present a chart
  showing its impact. I think this is really great! I also like that each
  optimization's impact was described separately before being implemented
  together.

- Your report is short, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I enjoy that the
  report isn't too verbose.

# Room for Improvement #
- Your copy optimization section is rather terse and doesn't explain in detail
  what copy optimizations you performed. From what I gather, you're copying A
  to be in row-major order. It would be nice if your report included why
  copying A to be in row-major order improves performance. Moreover, I think
  there are more opportunities for copy optimization to help. For example, you
  could play with copying the entirety of A at once or copying A block by block
  throughout the matrix multiplication. Moreover, by copying blocks of B into
  contiguous memory, you might be able to get improved cache performance even
  though you're leaving it in column-major order.

- Perhaps experiment with nested/hierarchical blocking.

- It would have been nice to see which compiler flags you used even if they
  didn't change the performance significantly.

# Anything Else #
- I saw in your code that you use the `restrict` compiler annotation. It would
  have been nice to see a section in your report on this.

- In your code you specify the L1, L2, and L3 cache sizes separately. It might
  interesting to see how modifying these values individually or all together
  affects the performance.
