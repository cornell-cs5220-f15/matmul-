# What Went Well #
- In your compiler flags section, you mention that you object dumped the binary
  to make sure that the compiler was actually doing what you wanted it to do.
  That's really awesome!

- Your section on SIMD is honestly the most beast thing I've ever read.

# Room for Improvement #
- You tried using the `-xAVX` flag. This website [1] will advise you to use the
  `-xCORE-AVX2` flag instead.

- You claim in you SIMD section that "it is widely recognized that manually
  inserting vector intrinsics is the preferred method of generating vector
  instructions." I would add a citation to support this claim. Otherwise, it is
  unjustified.

- It would have been nice to see a performance plot for the composition of all
  your optimizations. That is, it would have been nice to see the performance
  of a kernel with compiler flags, good loop ordering, and beast vector
  instruction stuff.

# Anything Else #
- Your report is great. You should push your tex source to your repo. We'd love
  to check it out!
