This is a review for Group 21 from Group 20 
1.What you think they did well (and why)
They've tried many ways to improve the performance. In the report, they give a detailed discussion about what they tried and what the result looks like. 

2.What you think they could improve on (and why)
They could try different combinations. For example, they could try to change block size or compiling flags after adding the restrict key word. These things may have interaction effect.

3.Anything else you would like to add
I think this group did things similar to us. So it's useful for us to see what they've tried.
