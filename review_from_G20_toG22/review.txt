This is a review for Group 22 from Group 20 
1.What you think they did well (and why)
They've tried several ways to improve the performance and they get good results. The vectorization they've done is good.  

2.What you think they could improve on (and why)
They could try some Compiler flags. 


3.Anything else you would like to add
I think it is better to show some intermediate result or add some discussion about how much each the different approach effects the perfomance in the report.
