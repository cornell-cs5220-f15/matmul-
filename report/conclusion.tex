\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
Fast matrix multiplication kernels are powerful and general tools. We
experimented with various kernel optimizations from copy optimization, compiler
flags, compiler annotations, and various blocking schemes. Using principled
software engineering, we then combined these optimizations into a set of fully
optimized kernels which are able to perform almost an order of magnitude more
Gflop/s than naive algorithms.
