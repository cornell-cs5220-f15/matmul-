\subsection{Vector Instructions}
In addition to scalar instructions, most modern instruction set architectures
also include vector instructions: instructions which operate on multiple
data in a single cycle. These instructions provide data-level parallelism that
can greatly increase the performance of code that exclusively uses scalar
instructions.

We tried to include explicit SSE instructions to operate on multiple doubles at
once. This, however, was unsuccessful. We suspect the Intel compiler already
did a good job of leveraging vector instructions since the performance only
decreased when we tried to use methods from \ttt{xmmintrin.h}. Although we did
end up getting this implementation to work, the added overhead and
complications of using data types and operations from \ttt{xmmintrin.h} only
resulted in slowing down our implementation.
