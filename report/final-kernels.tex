\section{Optimized Kernels}\label{sec:kernels}
After experimenting with various simple optimizations, we developed a
comprehensive set of kernels that combine and compose various optimizations as
well as introduce more complex optimizations. Concretely, we developed four
fully optimized kernels. In this section, we discuss the motivation and design
of each kernel. In \secref{eval}, we evaluate the performance of each kernel.
