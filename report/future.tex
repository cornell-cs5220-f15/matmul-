\todo{Update}
There are some further possible attempts at optimization that we would like to
try, but have not yet managed to implement in this first stage of the
assignment.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We could more rigorously experiment with the block size to determine which
    is fastest. We used ad-hoc manual tuning to arrive at our current block
    size. Further auto-tuning and principled reasoning would likely yield the
    optimal block size.

  \item
    We could change how we handle the parts of matrices that do not fit cleanly
    into blocks. Currently those are handled in a naive way, but one
    alternative would be to pad the matrix with zeros so that all (not almost
    all) multiplication occurs in consistently sized blocks. If the
    multiplication of blocks is sufficiently well optimized, then this could be
    noticeably faster.

  \item
    We could add an additional layer of constant-sized blocking. There is a
    possibility that the compiler can introduce more optimization if it knows
    the exact size of a loop at compile time. We could divide our smaller
    blocked multiplication into even smaller blocks of constant size.

  \item
    We could perform finer-grained and additional copy optimization. Currently,
    when we multiply two column-major matrices $A$ and $B$, we transpose $A$.
    Preferably, we would transpose blocks of $A$ rather than transposing it in
    its entirety. Furthermore, there could also be benefits to copying blocks
    of $B$ into contiguous memory regions.

  \item
    We could experiment with the \ttt{aligned} annotation.
\end{itemize}
