Figure out cluster architecture!!!
Basic blocked with different block sizes
4 unrolled blocked with different block sizes
Copy optimization (May lead to SSE implementation help)****
Aligning : double foo[128] __aligned((64));
icc vectorization report
Copy optimization to align
SWAR - SIMD within a register
Use restrict keyword properly

Programming 512 bit vector or use ftree-vectorize
march for cluster?
