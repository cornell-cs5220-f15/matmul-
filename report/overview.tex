\section{Overview}
Matrix multiplication is a ubiquitous linear algebra building block that can be
used to solve a wide variety of problems, and its popularity is an impetus for
its optimization. In this paper, we present our progress on writing an
optimized matrix multiplication kernel. In \secref{opt}, we review the
optimizations we used and attempted, as well as the motivation for these
optimizations and their results. In \secref{composing}, we discuss the process
of composing our optimizations into a single optimized matrix multiplication
kernel. In \secref{future}, we discuss future work and proposed optimizations.
