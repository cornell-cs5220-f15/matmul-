\section{Overview}
Matrix multiplication is a ubiquitous linear algebra building block that can be
used to solve a wide variety of problems, and its popularity is an impetus for
its optimization. In this paper, we present the development of a set of
optimized matrix multiplication kernels, as well as lend insights into which
optimizations are effective and why. In \secref{opt}, we review our initial
optimization experiments, as well as the motivation for these optimizations and
their results. In \secref{sweng}, we discuss various software engineering
principles we used to streamline kernel development. In \secref{kernels} and
\secref{eval}, we present and evaluate our set of fully optimized kernels.
Finally, in \secref{future} and \secref{conc}, we discuss future work and
conclusions.
