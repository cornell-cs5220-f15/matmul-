\section{Overview}
Matrix multiplication is a ubiquitous linear algebra building block that can be
used to solve a wide variety of problems, and its popularity is an impetus for
its optimization. In this paper, we present the development of a set of
optimized matrix multiplication kernels and lend insights into which
optimizations are effective and why. In \secref{opt}, we review our
experimentation with an initial set of optimizations, the motivation for these
optimizations, and their results. In \secref{sweng}, we discuss various
software engineering principles we used to streamline kernel development. In
\secref{kernels} and \secref{eval}, we present and evaluate our set of fully
optimized kernels.  Finally, in \secref{future} and \secref{conc}, we discuss
future work and conclusions.
