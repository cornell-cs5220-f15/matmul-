- Logistics
  - Cluster appears to work!
    - Most SW that I wanted is now built working
    - Login to Phi cards seems to be working (needs more testing)
  - Matmul assignment up (thanks to Eric)
    - Central group assignment for mixed teams (based on HW0)
    - Randomized with background constraints
    - Algorithmic recommendations are welcome! (aside: dining problem)
  - Do read the Roofline paper

- Demo: Matmul codes

  - Quick aside: how to think about matrix multiply
    - Inner product, outer product, blocked

- Class activities (thanks to Colin) - est 42 minutes

  - Go over questions, show the "right" answers, run some benchmarks to
    show an experimental performance profile and compare it to the
    predicted profile. (5 minutes)

  - Students get together, discuss how this picture changes for
    non-square matrices. (10 minutes)

  - Bring class together, discuss answers, show benchmarks for
    non-square matrices. (5 minutes)

  - Ask how to make this faster for larger problems. Give two key
    hints: 1) Addition is associative, so order of the matmul
    computation doesn't change answer (to within floating point
    error), and 2) As we've seen, naive matmul can be efficient for
    certain (smallish) problem sizes. (2 minutes)

  - Students get together to try to figure out what to do with
    that. Ask them to try computing arithmetic intensity for the more
    efficient solution they find. We walk around and help guide them
    to the idea of block matrix multiplication. (15 minutes)

  - If we have time, get together to discuss performance, show some
    benchmarks. (5 minutes)

- Switching gears: parallel architecture
  - Key bits: processors, memory, and interconnect
  - Interesting question is how they hook together
  - Differentiate: programming model vs architecture
