1. Look up the specs for the totient nodes. Having read the Roofline paper,
   draw a roofline diagram for one totient node (assuming only the
   host cores are used, for the moment).  How do things change with
   the addition of the two Phi boards?

2. What is the difference between two cores and one core with
   hyperthreading?

3. Do a Google search to find a picture of how memories are arranged
   on the Phi architecture.  Describe the setup briefly in your own
   words.  Is the memory access uniform or non-uniform?

4. Consider the parallel dot product implementations suggested in the
   slides.  As a function of the number of processors, the size of the
   vectors, and typical time to send a message, can you predict the
   speedup associated with parallelizing a dot product computation?
   [Note that dot products have low arithmetic intensity -- the
    roofline model may be useful for reasoning about the peak
    performance for computing pieces of the dot product]
